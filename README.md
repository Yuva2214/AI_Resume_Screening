# AI_Resume_Screening

The AI Resume Screening project automates candidate ranking by comparing uploaded resumes against a given job description. It extracts text from PDF resumes, processes the content using TF-IDF vectorization, and ranks candidates based on cosine similarity scores. The system provides a user-friendly Streamlit interface for inputting job descriptions and uploading resumes. Results are displayed in a ranked format with an option to download the rankings as a CSV file.
